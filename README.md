# Guessing-Game

This is a course project that uses Javascript/Html/Css with DOM manipulation to guess the right letters in a random word.

An array of strings has been created for the phrases

5 phrases are in the array

Phrases in array include only letters and spaces

A random, unknown phrase is chosen when the page loads

Each letter and space is appended to the phrase display

Only letters in the phrase have the class “letter”

Clicking a letter present in the phrase adds the “show” class to those letters in the display

Clicking a letter not present in the phrase increases the count of the missed variable by 1 and changes a liveHeart.png image to a lostHeart.png image.

No letter can be clicked twice

Clicking space between letters does nothing

If a player makes 5 wrong guesses, the “lose” overlay is shown

If all the letters in the phrase are shown, the “win” overlay is shown

A button has been added to the “lose” and “win” overlays to reset the game
